Django on Linux: 
This is the fisrt project in Django we do as fallow ; 
before begin the project you should check with this command your computer and install the missed;  
Open Terminal :- 
1- sudo apt install python3                                       This command for installing python3 on Linux
2-sudo apt install python3-pip                                   This command downloading the pip3 
3- pip3 -V                                                                  For checking the version of pip3 to make sure you get pip3
4- python -m pip install --upgrade pip                                    for upgrading the pip only 
5- pip3 install django                                                   Installing Django on the computer 
6-django-admin                                                           for checking django is there and every thing is ready for the project 
The Second Step and start the real project :::::----- 
1- django-admin startproject My_Site                          this is the first step for the django project and (My_Site) is the name of the project and it could be changed any time.
2- tree                                                                           this command for checking the project containes 
3- python3 manage.py runserver                                   this command to run the project to the browser and we use it many times   ///         this command is alternative            ./manage.py runserver
4- Crtl+C                                                                         this command for stopping the server working
For making app in our project and this is the second stage; 
1- python manage.py startapp blog                                 this command for making new app in main project of django
